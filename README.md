# CRM-SALES
Recommended Analysis
How is each sales team performing compared to the rest?
1. Are any sales agents lagging behind?
2. Can you identify any quarter-over-quarter trends?
3. Do any products have better win rates.

I went beyond the recommended analysis to create an inspiring dashboard. 
My analysis and visualization includes;
1. Deals won by quarters.
2. Top 5 agents based on the number of products sold.
3. Revenue (close value) generated by regional office.
4. Products by the close value. 
5. Top 5 products by deals won.
6. Least performing sectore by revenue.

SLicers Applied
1. Close date (month)
2. Deal stage
3. Series
